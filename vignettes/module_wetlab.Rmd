This vignette introduces the wetlab module in **LaminDB**, designed specifically for managing metadata associated with wetlab experiments.
This module provides a structured and standardized way to represent various aspects of your experimental workflows, ensuring data consistency and facilitating reproducibility.

For reference, here is the documentation on the [wetlab module](https://docs.lamin.ai/wetlab) for the LaminDB Python package.

## What is `wetlab`?

The wetlab module extends LaminDB with specialized registries for capturing essential information about your wetlab experiments. These registries include:

* **Experiments**: Represent overall experiments with details like objectives, design, and timelines.
* **Biosamples**: Capture information about biological specimens used in experiments (e.g., tissue, cells, blood).
* **Techsamples**: Represent processed or derived samples created from raw biological materials.
* **Treatments**: Model various types of treatments applied to samples, including compound treatments, environmental perturbations, and genetic modifications.
* **Treatment Targets**: Specify the targets of treatments, such as genes, proteins, or pathways.
* **Wells**: Represent individual wells in microplates or other experimental setups.
